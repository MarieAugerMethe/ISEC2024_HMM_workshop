# ISEC Hidden Markov Model: *Morning Tutorial*

Welcome to the morning tutorial! 

We will begin with a 30-minute introduction that will provide an overview of what are hidden Markov models (HMMs) and then we will complete together the activity found in the [Tutorial_files](./Tutorial_files/Tutorial_Narwhal_morning.Rmd) folder. The tutorial has some guided activities.



During most of the tutorial, we will look at a narwhal dataset provided by Dr. Marianne Marcoux. The narwhals have been tagged in Tremblay Sound, Nunavut, Canada. We will look at their movement over a two-week duration.

## Workshop learning objectives

- Understanding the statistical framework for HMMs and their applications to animal movement data
- Being able to fit HMMs to animal movement data to identify behaviours
- Being able to incorporate covariates on state transition probability to identify conditions that promote different behaviours
- Being able to integrate covariates on emission probabilities to model biased random walks 


## Preparation/instructions

- Download and unzip workshop zip from Github
- Install all the required packages as described in 0_Installing_packages.Rmd
- Make sure all packages are up-to-date as older versions may not work
- Modify the R Markdown file [R Markdown file (.Rmd)](./Tutorial_files/Tutorial_Narwhal_morning.Rmd) provided or 
create a new R or R Markdown file in the ISEC2024_HMM_workshop directory and follow along with the tutorial [html](./Tutorial_files/Tutorial_Narwhal_morning.html) file.

Let's go !
